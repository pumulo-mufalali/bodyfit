# Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Testing Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish comprehensive testing infrastructure, visual regression testing, and CI/CD improvements.

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Testing Infrastructure

### 1. Unit & Component Testing

1. **Vitest Configuration:** Configured `vitest.config.ts` with coverage thresholds (60% lines, functions, branches, statements), coverage provider (`@vitest/coverage-v8`), and test environment (jsdom)
2. **Test Files Created:** 9 unit/component test files covering retry logic, circuit breaker, error handling, unit conversion, and components (StatCard, ErrorBoundary, ProgressSummary)
3. **Test Scripts:** Added `test`, `test:ui`, and `test:coverage` to `package.json`

### 2. End-to-End Testing

1. **Playwright Configuration:** Created `playwright.config.ts` with test directory, browser configs (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), base URL, and web server setup
2. **E2E Test Suite:** Created 3 E2E test files:
   - `e2e/auth.spec.ts` - Authentication flow tests
   - `e2e/navigation.spec.ts` - Navigation tests
   - `e2e/workout-logging.spec.ts` - Workout logging flow tests
3. **E2E Test Scripts:** Added `test:e2e` and `test:e2e:ui` to `package.json`

### 3. Visual Regression Testing

1. **Storybook Configuration:** Created `.storybook/main.ts` and `.storybook/preview.ts` with Storybook 8.6.14, React Vite framework, and addons (essentials, interactions, links)
2. **Component Stories:** Created 2 Storybook story files:
   - `components/StatCard.stories.tsx` - 5 story variants (Default, WithProgress, WithIcon, Clickable, FullProgress)
   - `components/ProgressSummary.stories.tsx` - 4 story variants (Default, NoWorkouts, WeightGain, ManyWorkouts)
3. **Storybook Scripts:** Added `storybook` (port 6006) and `build-storybook` to `package.json`

### 4. CI/CD Improvements

1. **Coverage Reporting:** Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with coverage runs (`test:coverage`), Codecov uploads, and coverage file (`./apps/web/coverage/lcov.info`)
2. **Coverage Thresholds:** Configured in `vitest.config.ts`:

| Threshold | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Lines | 60% | Line coverage threshold |
| Functions | 60% | Function coverage threshold |
| Branches | 60% | Branch coverage threshold |
| Statements | 60% | Statement coverage threshold |

3. **Test Coverage Workflow:** Created `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml` with dedicated coverage job and Codecov integration

### 5. Documentation

1. **Testing Guide:** Created `docs/TESTING.md` with test types overview, structure examples, coverage reports, CI/CD integration, and best practices
2. **Existing Documentation:** Referenced `docs/RESILIENCE.md`, `docs/SEEDING.md`, and `docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`

## Technical Implementation

- **Testing Framework:** Vitest for unit/component tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Coverage:** @vitest/coverage-v8 with 60% thresholds for all metrics
- **Visual Testing:** Storybook 8.6.14 for component documentation and visual regression
- **CI/CD:** Coverage reporting in GitHub Actions with Codecov integration
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive testing documentation with examples and best practices
