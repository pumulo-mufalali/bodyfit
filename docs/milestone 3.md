# Phase 3: Advanced Features & Resilience

**Goal:** Add advanced features, multi-environment support, resilience patterns, and enhanced error handling.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Resilience

### 1. Achievements System

1. **Achievements Page:** Built `pages/AchievementsPage.tsx` for displaying unlocked achievements and milestones
2. **Achievement Service:** Created `firebase-achievement-service.ts` with achievement tracking and milestone recognition
3. **Activity Logging:** Implemented activity logging in `firebase-user-preferences-service.ts` for tracking user actions
4. **Milestone Recognition:** System for recognizing and awarding achievements based on user progress

### 2. Analytics & Progress Enhancement

1. **Detailed Stats Modal:** Enhanced `DetailedStatsModal.tsx` with advanced weight charts and statistics
2. **Progress Modal Enhancement:** Added multiple chart types (Line, Doughnut) and category-based exercise analytics to `ProgressModal.tsx`
3. **Weekly Progress Summaries:** Implemented weekly progress tracking with visual indicators
4. **Category Analytics:** Built category-based exercise analytics for insights into workout distribution

### 3. Multi-Environment Configuration

1. **Environment Switching:** Created `scripts/switch-env.js` for switching between dev/staging/prod environments
2. **Environment Scripts:** Added npm scripts (`env:dev`, `env:staging`, `env:prod`) in `package.json`
3. **Firebase Project Configuration:** Configured environment-specific Firebase projects with `firebase use` commands
4. **Deployment Scripts:** Created deployment scripts for each environment:
   - `deploy:dev` - Deploy to dev environment
   - `deploy:staging` - Deploy to staging environment
   - `deploy:prod` - Deploy to production environment

| Script | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `env:dev` | `node scripts/switch-env.js dev` | Switch to dev environment |
| `env:staging` | `node scripts/switch-env.js staging` | Switch to staging environment |
| `env:prod` | `node scripts/switch-env.js prod` | Switch to prod environment |
| `deploy:dev` | Environment switch + build + deploy | Full dev deployment |
| `deploy:staging` | Environment switch + build + deploy | Full staging deployment |
| `deploy:prod` | Environment switch + build + deploy | Full production deployment |

### 4. Resilience Patterns

1. **Retry Logic:** Created `utils/retry.ts` with exponential backoff:
   - Configurable max attempts (default: 3)
   - Exponential backoff between retries
   - Jitter to prevent thundering herd
   - Smart error detection (only retries retryable errors)

2. **Circuit Breaker:** Implemented `utils/circuit-breaker.ts` with:
   - Failure threshold (default: 5 failures)
   - Half-open state for recovery testing
   - Automatic circuit closure after timeout (default: 30 seconds)
   - Service-specific circuit breakers

3. **Resilient Client:** Created `utils/resilient-client.ts` wrapping `withResilience()` function:
   - Combines retry logic and circuit breaker patterns
   - Applied to `weightService`, `workoutService`, and `exerciseService`
   - Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Configurable retry and circuit breaker options per service

4. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Built `utils/error-handler.ts` and `utils/error-handler-extended.ts`:
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
   - Error logging and reporting
   - Graceful degradation

### 5. Data Services Enhancement

1. **Unit Conversion:** Created `lib/unit-conversion.ts` with:
   - Weight conversion (kg ↔ lbs)
   - Length conversion (cm ↔ inches)
   - `convertWeight()` function for weight data
   - `convertWeightData()` for batch conversion

2. **Enhanced Validation:** Added comprehensive input validation:
   - Weight validation (0.1 - 1000 kg)
   - Duration validation (0 - 1440 minutes)
   - Intensity validation ('low' | 'medium' | 'high')
   - Date validation and sanitization

3. **Activity Logging:** Implemented `logUserActivity()` for:
   - Tracking user actions (weight_logged, workout_logged, goal_created)
   - Activity metadata storage
   - Non-blocking activity logging
   - Activity history retrieval

4. **Settings Provider:** Enhanced `providers/settings-provider.tsx` with:
   - App-wide settings state management
   - Unit conversion support
   - Theme preferences
   - Settings persistence in Firestore

## Technical Implementation

- **Resilience Patterns:** Retry logic with exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern
- **Multi-Environment:** Environment-specific Firebase projects, deployment scripts
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error classification and user-friendly messages
- **Data Services:** Enhanced validation, unit conversion, activity logging
- **Performance:** Non-blocking operations, graceful degradation
